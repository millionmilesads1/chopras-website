## MASTER RULES — APPLY TO EVERY SINGLE PROMPT WITHOUT EXCEPTION

These rules override everything else. Claude Code must follow all of them on every page.

**INLINE LINKS — MANDATORY IN ALL PROSE:**
Every paragraph of 3 or more sentences must contain at least one inline Link component.
Links must use keyword-rich anchor text — never "click here", never "read more".
Use: className="text-[#D4AF37] hover:text-[#e8c84a] font-semibold"
Target pages come from sitemap.md. The GEO block paragraph must also contain inline links.
Minimum 8 inline links per page across all prose sections combined.

**BRAND STYLING — MANDATORY ON ALL SECTIONS:**
- H2: font-heading text-4xl md:text-5xl text-[#1B2B5E] mb-6 leading-[1.4]
- H3: font-heading text-2xl text-[#1B2B5E] mb-4
- Body: font-body text-[#1A1A1A] text-lg leading-relaxed
- Section padding: py-20 px-6 md:px-16
- NEVER use font-bold alone for headings

**FAQ — MANDATORY ON EVERY PAGE:**
Every page must have a FAQ section with 4-5 bilingual Q&A pairs.
Always use: <FaqAccordion faqs={isNl ? faqsNl : faqsEn} locale={locale} />
NEVER use raw <details> elements.
Define faqsEn and faqsNl as module-level constants before the component.
Wire getFaqPageSchema(isNl ? faqsNl : faqsEn) to a JsonLd block — NO date parameters.

**GEO BLOCK — MANDATORY ON EVERY PAGE:**
One visible section with a question-format H2 and a 60-100 word self-contained answer.
Must contain: restaurant name, address (Leyweg 986), primary service, verifiable fact, opening hours.
Must be bilingual using isNl conditional.
Must contain at least 2 inline Link components.

**FACTS — NEVER GET THESE WRONG:**
- Hours: Tuesday to Sunday, 16:30 to 22:30. Closed Monday.
- NO LUNCH SERVICE. Never write lunch, 11:30, 12:00, or any daytime food reference.
- Capacity: 25 to 80 guests. Never claim above 80.
- Reviews: "800+" not specific counts like "834".
- Delivery: Thuisbezorgd and Uber Eats (both, not just one).
- No alcohol served or permitted. Chopras is fully halal.

**BUILD CHECK — MANDATORY BEFORE EVERY COMMIT:**
Run pnpm build (not just pnpm tsc --noEmit).
Zero errors required. Fix all ESLint and build errors before committing.
Then: git add, git commit, git push origin main.
